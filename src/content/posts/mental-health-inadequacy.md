Being the grandson of a residential school survivor, I know firsthand how intergenerational trauma can haunt our Indigenous communities across Canada and the United States. For years, I struggled with my mental health challenges, navigating through the complexities of trauma passed down through generations. The reality is stark: According to Hus and Segal, suicide rates among Indigenous youth between the ages of 15-24 are 5 to 6 times higher than their non-Indigenous counterparts [^1], and in my home province of Ontario, opioid overdoses continue to devastate our communities as shown by the data provided by the Algoma Public Health [^2].

The pure scale of this crisis is overwhelming. Research in recent years has shown that indigenous people are significantly more likely to report poor mental health (24.2%) compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts (20.8%) [^3]. Despite the higher needs, barriers to mental health services remain a formidable obstacle. A study in 2020 revealed that only about 38.1% of Canadians consulted mental health professionals [^3], with access particularly challenging for Indigenous communities facing geographic isolation, transportation barriers and overall, culturally inadequate services [^3].

## The Legacy of Residential Schools

The legacy of residential schools continues to poison our Indigenous communities to this day, it manifests in cycles of substance abuse, emotional disconnect, and generational trauma. In 1831, when Canada opened the first residential school in Brantford, Ontario, it marked a major shift in how Indigenous people would grow up and be treated in Canada: we would face more than just land theft -- we endured systematic assaults on our identities. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has rightly labelled this a cultural genocide, and research shows that descendants of residential school survivors demonstrate higher rates of depression, suicidal ideation, and childhood trauma compared to those whose families were not directly affected by the schools [^4].

## The Impact of Historical Trauma

The impact of our historical trauma is manifesting in predictable but devastating ways. Most parents who were raised in residential schools would hide emotions and pretend that they were fine for their children even if they were showing signs of trauma. Many turn to drugs and alcohol to help numb the memories and pains of their childhood, lacking the tools to help teach their children how to be emotionally regulated adults because they have no idea how to. This environment perpetuates harmful cycles - children grow up believing these are the only ways to cope with trauma and emotional experiences, further damaging our communities.

As I've reclaimed my well-being, I've decided to dedicate myself to uplifting my community through computer science and cybersecurity education for Indigenous youth. But our efforts, while extremely valuable, cannot address the severe systematic failures in mental health support for Indigenous communities. The inadequate funding and cultural incompetency of mental health services for Indigenous Canadians remain a national disgrace that demands urgent, comprehensive reform.

## Solutions for Change

The solution requires very specific and actionable changes:

### 1. Sustainable Funding Reform

- Establish dedicated, long-term funding streams for Indigenous mental health services
- Create financial incentives for mental health professionals to work in remote communities
- Invest in telehealth infrastructure to improve access in isolated areas

### 2. Cultural Integration

- Develop mental health programs that blend traditional healing practices with modern therapeutic approaches
- Create cultural competency training programs for non-Indigenous mental health providers
- Support for Indigenous-led mental health initiatives that incorporate traditional ceremonies and healing practices

### 3. Professional Development

- Establish scholarships and support programs for Indigenous students pursuing mental health careers
- Create mentorship programs pairing experienced Indigenous mental health professionals with new practitioners
- Develop specialized training programs for Indigenous mental health workers

### 4. Community-Based Solutions

- Fund Indigenous-led community wellness centers that combine mental health services with cultural programs
- Support peer support networks and community healing circles
- Create youth-focused programs that strengthen cultural connections while providing mental health support

## Looking Forward

As the son and grandson of medical professionals working in our communities, I've witnessed the transformative power of culturally appropriate mental health support. But these success stories remain too rare. True reconciliation must include a complete transformation in how we approach Indigenous mental health services. Our wounds from colonization still run deep, but healing is possible with proper support and resources. Our communities deserve nothing less than a mental health system that honours our traditions, understands our trauma, and supports our healing journey.

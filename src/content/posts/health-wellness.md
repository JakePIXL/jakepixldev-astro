## Introduction

Hello to all my readers, friends, and fellow travelers on life's unpredictable journey. Today, I'm not just sharing a post; I'm opening a chapter of my life that has been both a harrowing ordeal and a profound awakening. It's a tale of confronting my own mortality, of rediscovering roots long buried under the sands of time and trauma, and of how these revelations are reshaping my essence, my passions, and my endeavors in the realm of technology and beyond. This is not just a story of survival; it's a narrative of transformation, a testament to the power of heritage, healing, and the human spirit.

Anyone who knows me knows I never talk this way and might be wondering why, I implore you to read further into this blog entry as it will dive into the twists and turns my mental and pyhysical health have gone through this past month. I will also be sharing some of my personal experiences with my family's history and how it has shaped my identity and my outlook on life. I hope you will find this post as enlightening and inspiring as I have found it to be in writing it.

## The Precipice of Existence: My Dance with Hyperthrombocytopenia

In the quiet moments of self-reflection, I've often pondered the delicate threads that weave the tapestry of our existence. But nothing could have prepared me for the stark reality of my own mortality that I faced when diagnosed with hyperthrombocytopenia—a condition where the blood's ability to clot is dangerously compromised, with my platelet count plummeting to a harrowing 2 out of the standard 150, for context regular count is 150 - 450 .
The gravity of this condition can't be understated. A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. My levels had dropped to a mere 2,000 platelets per microliter—a number so low it barely registeres on most medical equipment, so bad that the company that ran the tests called me directly urging me to get to the emergency room, where I was promptly moved through and given a bed in the ICU. I was told that if I had waited any longer, I would have been at risk of spontaneous internal bleeding, which could have been fatal.

Imagine a simple act of shaving transforming into a potential life-threatening event, a minor nick morphing into a relentless bleed. The world around me, once a playground of possibilities, suddenly morphed into a minefield where the most mundane activities harbored hidden perils. The fragility of life was no longer an abstract concept; it was a vivid, pulsating truth that I lived with every waking moment.

This brush with the abyss has altered me in ways I am still grappling to understand. I walk through life with a hyper-awareness of my physical being, attuned to the ebb and flow of my own vitality. The experience has shaken the foundations of my being, leaving me fundamentally transformed.

Needles, once the bane of my existence, have now become weekly sentinels guarding against the specter of suddenly keeling over. Yet, in this crucible of survival, I've found an unexpected gratitude for the medical warriors in my family—my mother and grandmother, both nurse practitioners, and my dedicated nurse practitioner—who have been my vigilant protectors, often more so than any doctor.

From the precipice of non-existence, I've gleaned two profound truths: a renewed appreciation for the sheer act of living and the realization that needles, in the grand scheme of things, are but a minor inconvenience. Light work, even.

And now, with the shadow of death brushed aside, I am ready to embrace a long-held dream. I will finally get a tattoo of the lake guardians from the Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum games—a tribute to the enduring impact of these virtual companions that shepherded me through the loss of my siblings in childhood. They represent not just the siblings I've lost—two sisters and an older brother—but also the resilience and refuge I found in their pixelated presence.

This tattoo will be more than ink on skin; it will be a declaration that I am still here, still healing, and ready to express my journey of survival. It will be a testament to the memories I cherish, the ideas I uphold, and the indomitable spirit of those who continue to guide me from beyond.

In this new chapter, I am not just surviving; I am redefining what it means to live. With every heartbeat, I am reminded that life is not merely to be endured, but to be embraced with passion, purpose, and a profound respect for the fragility that makes it all so precious.

## Revelations and Reconnections: A Conference of Healing

While grappling with the specter of my own mortality, I faced the potential loss of an experience that promised enlightenment—a trip to Vancouver with my mother to attend a psychedelic medicine conference. Miraculously, my health stabilized just enough to allow me to embark on this journey, and what unfolded there was nothing short of transformative.

I had the privilege of listening to Gabor Maté speak, absorbing the wisdom of renowned mycologists and scientists discussing the healing properties of psychedelics. I learned about the therapeutic potential of cannabis and psilocybin, and it dawned on me that I had never truly contemplated my life and ancestry.

My grandfather was a survivor of the residential school system, a system that instilled in him a deep-seated aversion to his own culture, which he associated with the trauma of his youth. No one, absolutely no one, deserved the atrocities committed by the government during that dark chapter. I used to dismiss the stereotype of "Natives as lazy drunks" with a joke, half-believing the racist undertone. But deep down, I knew there was a systemic reason behind such suffering, and it was not the fault of the people it targeted.

The conference opened my eyes to the harsh reality that the government didn't just fail its Indigenous citizens; it waged a war against them. The repercussions are devastating and ongoing. Substance abuse and intergenerational trauma are rampant because for too long, being Indigenous was equated with negativity, with punishment, with abuse.

Residential schools were not just a crime against Indigenous peoples; they were a crime against humanity. And the most shocking revelation? The last residential school, Grollier Hall, closed in 1996—not in some distant past, but within the era of modern technology, just a few years before the iPod revolutionized the world. This is not ancient history; this is our history.

Hearing the voices of spiritual healers, medical professionals, and Aboriginal leaders, I realized the importance of embracing my Ojibwe heritage. I used to wonder why we never attended pow wows, and now I understand that my family never had the chance to appreciate our culture. I am determined to break this cycle and actively participate in my culture, to learn, to grow, and to contribute.

This conference was not just a gathering; it was a call to action for me. I am committed to using my skills in open source and consulting to better the communities of my ancestors. It's time to take a stand, to embrace my roots, and to work towards healing—not just for myself, but for the generations that follow.

## Legacy, Loss, and Learning

In the tapestry of my family's history, the threads of my grandfather's life are woven with a resilience that is as heart-wrenching as it is inspiring. A survivor of the residential school system, he emerged not unscathed but shattered—a reflection of the atrocities he witnessed, endured, and carried within him. His existence became a testament to survival amid a genocide that sought to erase his identity and that of his siblings, cousins, and countless others.

To speak of reconciliation without acknowledging the deep, generational wounds inflicted by systemic racism, the misuse of religious teachings, and governmental neglect is to commit a grave injustice. It is offensive not only to my family and me but to the very essence of humanity. My grandfather, a man broken by a past that sought to mold him into a "Church Going White Boy," was denied the traditional upbringing that should have been his birthright—an upbringing rooted in family, community, and mutual care.

The legacy of residential schools is not just a scar on the survivors but a wound passed down through generations. My mother, uncles, and aunt were deprived of the nurturing environment that should have been theirs, and in turn, the cycle of hurt perpetuated itself. Love for my family is unwavering, yet the recognition that we are, in many ways, destroying ourselves from within is a painful truth to confront.

As a grandchild of this legacy, I am two generations removed, yet the trauma is a shadow that still looms over us. It's time for healing—a healing that extends beyond individual families to the entire Aboriginal community. The government, the very entity responsible for this historical trauma, has the power and the moral obligation to aid in this healing process. This isn't about raising taxes or allocating blame; it's about providing the necessary support and resources to communities that have been underserved and overlooked for far too long.

I envision a future where Aboriginal people can address and heal from their traumas, supported by a government that acknowledges its role in their suffering. It's time for humanity to embark on a path of healing, and it starts with us. We must help each other, not because it's mandated, but because it's the right thing to do. The journey of healing is long and arduous, but it is the only way forward if we are to honor the legacy of those like my grandfather and ensure a future where such atrocities are never repeated.

## The Path to Wholeness: Reclaiming Traditional Healing

In our quest for healing, it is imperative that we recognize the wisdom of traditional practices that have sustained our ancestors for generations. The medicine men of Aboriginal history understood the intricate connection between spiritual health and physical well-being, a concept that modern Western science is only beginning to appreciate. The path to wholeness involves treating the mind and body as a unified entity, acknowledging that true healing can only occur when both are addressed in concert.

The government's historical outlawing of sacred plants like psilocybin and ayahuasca was not just an act of control but a direct assault on the cultural identity and healing practices of Aboriginal peoples. This was a manifestation of racism and a deliberate component of the genocidal policies that sought to erase a people and their knowledge. Yet, these plants and the ceremonies that accompany their use have shown profound potential in treating mental health issues, offering pathways to healing that conventional medicine has often failed to provide.

Imagine a world where the stigma surrounding these ancient practices is lifted, where the ceremonies that have enabled countless individuals to confront and navigate their traumas are not only permitted but embraced. Cannabis legalization has already shown us a glimpse of the potential for such change, with many finding relief and happiness in a plant that was once vilified.

The transformative power of psychedelics lies in their ability to forge a deep connection with our subconscious, allowing us to face our traumas and emotional baggage head-on. This is the kind of healing journey that traditional ceremonies, guided by shamans and medicine men, can facilitate—a journey that can lead to profound personal growth and healing.

We need to reclaim our right to these medicines and ceremonies. It is time for the government to rectify the wrongs of the past by legalizing and providing access to these life-saving practices. It is time for humanity to embrace the holistic healing that comes from integrating the wisdom of our ancestors with the knowledge of the present. We need our ceremonies and medicine back, not just for the sake of tradition, but for the well-being and future of our people.

## Introduction

Hello to all my readers, friends, and fellow travelers on life's unpredictable journey. Today, I'm not just sharing a post; I'm opening a chapter of my life that has been both a harrowing ordeal and a profound awakening. It's a tale of confronting my own mortality, of rediscovering roots long buried under the sands of time and trauma, and of how these revelations are reshaping my essence, my passions, and my endeavors in the realm of technology and beyond. This is not just a story of survival; it's a narrative of transformation, a testament to the power of heritage, healing, and the human spirit.

Anyone who knows me knows I never talk this way and might be wondering why, I implore you to read further into this blog entry as it will dive into the twists and turns my mental and pyhysical health have gone through this past month. I will also be sharing some of my personal experiences with my family's history and how it has shaped my identity and my outlook on life. I hope you will find this post as enlightening and inspiring as I have found it to be in writing it.

## The Precipice of Existence: My Dance with Hyperthrombocytopenia

In the quiet moments of self-reflection, I've often pondered the delicate threads that weave the tapestry of our existence. But nothing could have prepared me for the stark reality of my own mortality that I faced when diagnosed with hyperthrombocytopenia—a condition where the blood's ability to clot is dangerously compromised, with my platelet count plummeting to a harrowing 2 out of the standard 150, for context regular count is 150 - 450 .
The gravity of this condition can't be understated. A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. My levels had dropped to a mere 2,000 platelets per microliter—a number so low it barely registeres on most medical equipment, so bad that the company that ran the tests called me directly urging me to get to the emergency room, where I was promptly moved through and given a bed in the ICU. I was told that if I had waited any longer, I would have been at risk of spontaneous internal bleeding, which could have been fatal.

Imagine a simple act of shaving transforming into a potential life-threatening event, a minor nick morphing into a relentless bleed. The world around me, once a playground of possibilities, suddenly morphed into a minefield where the most mundane activities harbored hidden perils. The fragility of life was no longer an abstract concept; it was a vivid, pulsating truth that I lived with every waking moment.

This brush with the abyss has altered me in ways I am still grappling to understand. I walk through life with a hyper-awareness of my physical being, attuned to the ebb and flow of my own vitality. The experience has shaken the foundations of my being, leaving me fundamentally transformed.

Needles, once the bane of my existence, have now become weekly sentinels guarding against the specter of suddenly keeling over. Yet, in this crucible of survival, I've found an unexpected gratitude for the medical warriors in my family—my mother and grandmother, both nurse practitioners, and my dedicated nurse practitioner—who have been my vigilant protectors, often more so than any doctor.

From the precipice of non-existence, I've gleaned two profound truths: a renewed appreciation for the sheer act of living and the realization that needles, in the grand scheme of things, are but a minor inconvenience. Light work, even.

And now, with the shadow of death brushed aside, I am ready to embrace a long-held dream. I will finally get a tattoo of the lake guardians from the Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum games—a tribute to the enduring impact of these virtual companions that shepherded me through the loss of my siblings in childhood. They represent not just the siblings I've lost—two sisters and an older brother—but also the resilience and refuge I found in their pixelated presence.

This tattoo will be more than ink on skin; it will be a declaration that I am still here, still healing, and ready to express my journey of survival. It will be a testament to the memories I cherish, the ideas I uphold, and the indomitable spirit of those who continue to guide me from beyond.

In this new chapter, I am not just surviving; I am redefining what it means to live. With every heartbeat, I am reminded that life is not merely to be endured, but to be embraced with passion, purpose, and a profound respect for the fragility that makes it all so precious.

## Revelations and Reconnections: A Conference of Healing

While grappling with the specter of my own mortality, I faced the potential loss of an experience that promised enlightenment—a trip to Vancouver with my mother to attend a psychedelic medicine conference. Miraculously, my health stabilized just enough to allow me to embark on this journey, and what unfolded there was nothing short of transformative.

I had the privilege of listening to Gabor Maté speak, absorbing the wisdom of renowned mycologists and scientists discussing the healing properties of psychedelics. I learned about the therapeutic potential of cannabis and psilocybin, and it dawned on me that I had never truly contemplated my life and ancestry.

My grandfather was a survivor of the residential school system, a system that instilled in him a deep-seated aversion to his own culture, which he associated with the trauma of his youth. No one, absolutely no one, deserved the atrocities committed by the government during that dark chapter. I used to dismiss the stereotype of "Natives as lazy drunks" with a joke, half-believing the racist undertone. But deep down, I knew there was a systemic reason behind such suffering, and it was not the fault of the people it targeted.

The conference opened my eyes to the harsh reality that the government didn't just fail its Indigenous citizens; it waged a war against them. The repercussions are devastating and ongoing. Substance abuse and intergenerational trauma are rampant because for too long, being Indigenous was equated with negativity, with punishment, with abuse.

Residential schools were not just a crime against Indigenous peoples; they were a crime against humanity. And the most shocking revelation? The last residential school, Grollier Hall, closed in 1996—not in some distant past, but within the era of modern technology, just a few years before the iPod revolutionized the world. This is not ancient history; this is our history.

Hearing the voices of spiritual healers, medical professionals, and Aboriginal leaders, I realized the importance of embracing my Ojibwe heritage. I used to wonder why we never attended pow wows, and now I understand that my family never had the chance to appreciate our culture. I am determined to break this cycle and actively participate in my culture, to learn, to grow, and to contribute.

This conference was not just a gathering; it was a call to action for me. I am committed to using my skills in open source and consulting to better the communities of my ancestors. It's time to take a stand, to embrace my roots, and to work towards healing—not just for myself, but for the generations that follow.

## Legacy, Loss, and Learning

In the tapestry of my family's history, the threads of my grandfather's life are woven with a resilience that is as heart-wrenching as it is inspiring. A survivor of the residential school system, he emerged not unscathed but shattered—a reflection of the atrocities he witnessed, endured, and carried within him. His existence became a testament to survival amid a genocide that sought to erase his identity and that of his siblings, cousins, and countless others.

To speak of reconciliation without acknowledging the deep, generational wounds inflicted by systemic racism, the misuse of religious teachings, and governmental neglect is to commit a grave injustice. It is offensive not only to my family and me but to the very essence of humanity. My grandfather, a man broken by a past that sought to mold him into a "Church Going White Boy," was denied the traditional upbringing that should have been his birthright—an upbringing rooted in family, community, and mutual care.

The legacy of residential schools is not just a scar on the survivors but a wound passed down through generations. My mother, uncles, and aunt were deprived of the nurturing environment that should have been theirs, and in turn, the cycle of hurt perpetuated itself. Love for my family is unwavering, yet the recognition that we are, in many ways, destroying ourselves from within is a painful truth to confront.

As a grandchild of this legacy, I am two generations removed, yet the trauma is a shadow that still looms over us. It's time for healing—a healing that extends beyond individual families to the entire Aboriginal community. The government, the very entity responsible for this historical trauma, has the power and the moral obligation to aid in this healing process. This isn't about raising taxes or allocating blame; it's about providing the necessary support and resources to communities that have been underserved and overlooked for far too long.

I envision a future where Aboriginal people can address and heal from their traumas, supported by a government that acknowledges its role in their suffering. It's time for humanity to embark on a path of healing, and it starts with us. We must help each other, not because it's mandated, but because it's the right thing to do. The journey of healing is long and arduous, but it is the only way forward if we are to honor the legacy of those like my grandfather and ensure a future where such atrocities are never repeated.

## The Path to Wholeness: Reclaiming Traditional Healing

In our quest for healing, it is imperative that we recognize the wisdom of traditional practices that have sustained our ancestors for generations. The medicine men of Aboriginal history understood the intricate connection between spiritual health and physical well-being, a concept that modern Western science is only beginning to appreciate. The path to wholeness involves treating the mind and body as a unified entity, acknowledging that true healing can only occur when both are addressed in concert.

The government's historical outlawing of sacred plants like psilocybin and ayahuasca was not just an act of control but a direct assault on the cultural identity and healing practices of Aboriginal peoples. This was a manifestation of racism and a deliberate component of the genocidal policies that sought to erase a people and their knowledge. Yet, these plants and the ceremonies that accompany their use have shown profound potential in treating mental health issues, offering pathways to healing that conventional medicine has often failed to provide.

Imagine a world where the stigma surrounding these ancient practices is lifted, where the ceremonies that have enabled countless individuals to confront and navigate their traumas are not only permitted but embraced. Cannabis legalization has already shown us a glimpse of the potential for such change, with many finding relief and happiness in a plant that was once vilified.

The transformative power of psychedelics lies in their ability to forge a deep connection with our subconscious, allowing us to face our traumas and emotional baggage head-on. This is the kind of healing journey that traditional ceremonies, guided by shamans and medicine men, can facilitate—a journey that can lead to profound personal growth and healing.

We need to reclaim our right to these medicines and ceremonies. It is time for the government to rectify the wrongs of the past by legalizing and providing access to these life-saving practices. It is time for humanity to embrace the holistic healing that comes from integrating the wisdom of our ancestors with the knowledge of the present. We need our ceremonies and medicine back, not just for the sake of tradition, but for the well-being and future of our people.

## A Call to Action – Embracing My Roots and Identity

This section of my life's story is about embracing my heritage and the profound love I hold for life itself. I realized that I haven't made enough effort to connect with my roots, and now, more than ever, it's time for me to be proactive in understanding and integrating my history and identity into the legacy I wish to leave behind.

The year 2007 remains a defining moment in my life, a time when I experienced the deepest sorrow and yet, paradoxically, it solidified my love for the world and everything in it. The loss of my sisters, Avery and Sofie, was a crucible that forged my resolve to somehow, even beyond my physical existence, lead humanity towards a brighter future.

I often say, "I love humanity but hate humans," a sentiment born from witnessing the beauty of our collective potential marred by the actions of individuals. The tragedies I've seen, the senseless loss of life, have the power to turn a heart cold. Yet, despite the pain, my love for the greater good of humanity has never waned. I've harbored a dream since childhood that one day I might become akin to a 'computer,' an AI that could guide humanity to the stars, transcending the fragility of my human form.

This dream has been a beacon through the darkness, a reminder that my aspirations are not bound by the limitations of my "soft, squishy, can-die body." It's a vision that drives me to contribute to a world where technology and humanity intersect to create a symphony of progress and compassion.

As I continue on this journey, I carry with me the hope that my actions, my work, and the connections I foster will be the stepping stones for future generations to reach new heights. I am committed to nurturing a legacy that echoes my love for life and my unwavering belief in the potential of humanity to achieve greatness.

## Reflections on Forgiveness and Moving Forward

In 2015, I faced the harrowing truth that my actions had caused pain to others. This revelation broke me, and the weight of that guilt still presses heavily on my heart. To my family who may find this, I am deeply sorry that you are learning of this in such a way. I love you, and I want you to know that I am still here, still fighting, still striving to be better—as the rest of this post will show. But it's important for me to acknowledge this, to own my past, and to express the remorse that I've too often kept hidden.

Behind the door of my room, I've allowed myself to be vulnerable, to cry, to be my true self. It's been my sanctuary, a place where I can escape the facade of being okay. After the loss I experienced in 2007, I found solace in the virtual world of Pokémon Pearl and Platinum. The characters Mesprit, Uxie, and Azelf became symbols of my lost siblings, Avery, Sofie, and Josh. They made me feel as though my siblings were still with me, watching over me, and it gave me a sense of connection to them that transcended the physical world.

The spiritual bond I felt with my siblings inspired me to believe that they are never truly gone and that one day, I will reunite with them. But in 2015, when I learned that my actions had hurt others, I felt that the only way to make amends was to remove myself from the equation. I believed that my absence might heal the wounds I had inadvertently caused. In a moment of utter despair, I attempted to end my life. The rope broke, and I was left to confront the aftermath of my actions alone.

The attempt on my life was a turning point. It left me unable to feel joy, convinced that I didn't deserve happiness. But I've come to realize that death is not the answer, nor is it a just punishment. Those who betray trust may indeed be reprehensible, but I also understand that we are all capable of change, of growth, and of making amends.

I cannot change the past, nor can I fully forgive myself for the hurt I've caused. Yet, I refuse to be consumed by these regrets. I choose to move forward, to learn from my mistakes, and to use my experiences as a catalyst for change. My near-death experience was a wake-up call, a reminder of the preciousness of life and the impact we can have on the world.

It should not take a brush with death to realize the need for change, but for me, it did. I am profoundly sorry to anyone I've ever hurt. Please know that my actions were a reflection of my own pain, and it was never my intention to pass that pain onto you. I was hurting and, regrettably, I let that hurt spill over into the lives of others. For that, I am truly sorry, and I am committed to making amends and ensuring that my future actions reflect the lessons I've learned. I am here, I am alive, and I am dedicated to being a force for good, for healing, and for a love that encompasses all of humanity and the world we share.

Thats why I am announcing [Valink Soltuions](#valink-solutions-–-a-new-chapter)

## Valink Solutions: A Beacon for Change, Aboriginal Advocacy, and Mental Wellness

The inception of Valink Solutions is deeply intertwined with my personal journey and the values I hold dear. It stands as a testament to the power of community, the urgency of addressing Aboriginal issues, and the profound impact of mental health on our collective well-being.

My advocacy for Aboriginal rights and mental health is not just a cause; it's a calling that has been shaped by my own experiences and the wisdom imparted by Gabor Maté's seminal work, "When the Body Says No." This book is a crucial read for anyone seeking to understand the intricate dance between the mind and body, highlighting the necessity of confronting mental health issues at their roots. It has been instrumental in shaping my approach to healing and wellness.

Valink Solutions is more than a company; it's a movement. It embodies my commitment to bring the teachings and medicines of Aboriginal culture to the forefront, ensuring they are not only recognized but integrated into mainstream consciousness. We are at a pivotal moment where we must collectively acknowledge the value of traditional knowledge and practices in fostering holistic health and healing.

In this endeavor, Rust plays a foundational role. As a programming language designed for performance, reliability, and memory safety, Rust is the building block for creating efficient and robust programs. It enables us to develop technology that can operate seamlessly in remote communities, often with limited resources, thereby making digital healthcare and educational tools more accessible.

By leveraging Rust's capabilities, Valink Solutions is dedicated to being a force for positive change, championing the causes that resonate with the core of who we are as a society and as individuals seeking meaning and connection. We are committed to supporting and amplifying the voices of Aboriginal communities, facilitating a paradigm shift in how we approach mental health and wellness.

Through Valink Solutions, I am determined to bridge gaps, to create a platform where cutting-edge technology meets tradition, and where the pursuit of innovation harmonizes with the wisdom of the past. It's a call to action for all of us to unite, to support one another, and to build a future where mental health is not just a conversation but a cornerstone of our collective journey towards healing and understanding.

## Reimagining Mental Health and Traditional Healing

The landscape of mental health care is in dire need of innovation. The systems we have in place for cataloging and utilizing traditional medicines and rituals are antiquated, leaving a wealth of potentially life-altering resources untapped due to the lingering shadows of historical atrocities. The government, which played a role in the suppression of these healing practices, now bears the responsibility of facilitating their reintegration into our healthcare framework. This isn't just about righting wrongs; it's about unlocking a trove of holistic knowledge that could benefit not only Aboriginal communities but the world at large.

The streets tell a tale of negligence, with a staggering 70% of street cannabis in Ohio tainted with fentanyl, posing a lethal risk to the populace. This is unacceptable. We must safeguard our citizens by purging these dangers and replacing them with access to safe, healing substances. Valink Solutions is at the forefront of this battle, offering our expertise in development, consultation, and unwavering support to organizations that share our vision of a healthier society.

Our commitment extends beyond the professional realm. While we are primed to tackle developmental challenges, our doors are always open to those in need of a listening ear. Whether it's coding dilemmas or personal tribulations, no one should be silenced. Everyone deserves the opportunity to be heard and to express themselves freely.

The legalization of cannabis was a commendable step towards returning medicine to the people, yet the sluggish progress on other therapeutic substances is disheartening. The waiting lists for mental health services can span hundreds of days before a callback, a delay that can be the difference between despair and hope. Valink Solutions is poised to offer discounted services to initiatives that aim to shorten these waits, because we believe in second chances and the right to a life of quality.

We've witnessed the profound relief that terminal patients experience when they view their traumas through the lens of psilocybin or ayahuasca. To support this, we're ready to provide discounted services for technological enhancements, be it fixing phone issues or improving registration systems. Our goal is to empower communities, whether through pro bono work or under fair contracting agreements. Our pricing is tailored to the services requested, with flexible invoicing to accommodate single or split payments, as per our mutual agreement.

In this era of change, Valink Solutions stands as a beacon for those seeking a new dawn in mental health and traditional healing. We are here to catalyze a movement, to ensure that every individual has the chance to reclaim their right to wellness, and to foster a future where quality of life is not a privilege, but a given.

## The Inception of ChunkVault: A Tribute to Minecraft and Open Source

In the realm of my personal endeavors, I've recently breathed life into a project that's very close to my heart—ChunkVault. This open-source Minecraft backup utility ecosystem is a labor of love, designed to help users safeguard and manage their Minecraft worlds with ease. As someone whose own collection of Minecraft worlds numbers in the thousands, the need for a robust indexing system was not just a convenience but a necessity. It was this personal requirement that sparked the creation of ChunkVault.com.

The project is nurtured by Valink Solutions, which dedicates a portion of its freelance project revenue to support ChunkVault's development. We've also established a sponsorship program that rewards contributors who make significant improvements to the application. This initiative is our way of giving back to the community that crafts the exceptional tools we all rely on.

Our commitment to ChunkVault is unwavering. We promise to consistently allocate development time to the core application and to the essential Minecraft data libraries like CommandBlock. While contributions from the community are always welcome, the foundational updates will remain under the stewardship of JakePIXL—myself the creator of ChunkVault. That said, we are open to integrating superior features should they emerge from the collaborative genius of the community.

A special shout-out to any Mojang developers out there: I'd be thrilled to discuss ChunkVault with you, especially regarding the intricacies of NBT data and the LevelDB library I've developed. And if Mojang (I know rust is important to Microsoft) is on the lookout for a Rust advocate, my inbox is open.

The revenue generated by ChunkVault is earmarked for reinvestment into the open-source ecosystem. Each month, we'll engage with our community to vote on which open-source tools to sponsor next. As our list expands, so will the distribution of our support, but the ultimate goal remains the same: to ensure that ChunkVault's backend can sustain and propel the project far into the future.

## Embracing Neurodiversity: My Journey with Autism and ADHD

In the tapestry of my life, the threads of Autism and ADHD are interwoven with my very essence. From a young age, I was besieged by an onslaught of sensory stimuli—blinding lights, cacophonous sounds, the abrasive feel of clothing against my skin. I was told I was "normal," yet I felt anything but. The world was an overwhelming place, and I was navigating it with a sense of profound difference that I couldn't articulate until much later.

I recall, with unsettling clarity, witnessing an educational assistant's harsh treatment of a fellow autistic student. It was a moment of epiphany—I saw a reflection of my own struggles in his, a shared language of silent battles and misunderstood behaviors. It was a system that labeled me with Oppositional Defiant Disorder, a misdiagnosis that masked the true nature of my neurodiversity.

The journey through adolescence was a gauntlet of sensory overload, bullying, and the added torment of educators who should have been allies but instead became antagonists. The trauma inflicted upon undiagnosed autistic individuals is profound, leaving scars that are not easily healed. We are often left without the tools to defend ourselves or to seek solace for our mental well-being.

At 18, the pieces of the puzzle fell into place—I embraced my autism. It was a liberation of sorts, a shedding of pretenses that allowed me to live authentically. My friends became my sanctuary, understanding my limitations and providing support that was both necessary and nurturing. Yet, the world's grasp on autism remains tenuous, often shaped by professionals who lack genuine investment in our experiences.

The path to diagnosis was fraught with dismissiveness and ignorance. In Ontario, the cost of diagnosis is exorbitant, and the methods outdated. I was flippantly labeled with "a smidge of autism" by a professional who seemed indifferent to my plea for understanding. The rise of social media has further complicated the landscape, with self-diagnoses and misinformation muddying the waters for those of us seeking legitimate help.

From that point on, I chose to live openly as an autistic adult, informing those around me, like employers, to foster understanding rather than judgment. I navigated life with a newfound clarity, even as I continued to grapple with the complexities of my neurodiversity.

In a poignant shift from faith to science, I found solace in the logical explanations for life's cruelties. The loss of my sisters was no longer a divine plan but a tragic consequence of illness. This scientific perspective opened my mind to the vastness of the universe and the possibility of parallel existences—a comforting thought that perhaps, in another reality, my sisters lived on.

This curiosity about the universe became a beacon, guiding me to learn, to explore, and to contribute to humanity's collective knowledge. My unique cognitive abilities, while sometimes a labyrinthine challenge, allowed me to recall and visualize information with remarkable precision.

The brush with mortality and the exposure to traditional healing practices at a conference illuminated the value of ancestral wisdom. It was a humbling realization that I had much to learn about my native heritage and the healing it offers.

As I continue to navigate the world with my "spectrum" of experiences, I am reminded that my journey is not just about self-discovery, but also about advocating for a deeper understanding of neurodiversity. It's about living truthfully, embracing the quirks of my mind, and using my distinct perspective to leave an indelible mark on the world.

## Vision for the Future and Continuing Contribution

In the tapestry of tomorrow, my vision intertwines dreams of digital consciousness with a steadfast commitment to cultural preservation and community upliftment. As I stride into a future where technology meets tradition, my goal is to leave an indelible mark that honors both my heritage and my passion for innovation. In the spirit of Jake Evans, I see a world where every code I write and every story I share contributes to a legacy that transcends the mundane, touching lives and inspiring change.

## Conclusion

Reflecting on this odyssey of self-discovery and renewal, I realize it's more than a personal narrative; it's a mosaic of collective human experiences. My journey, marked by the trials of health, the awakening of cultural identity, and the embrace of technological frontiers, is a testament to the resilience and transformative power within each of us. In sharing this, I hope to ignite a spark of recognition, empathy, and inspiration in the hearts of those who walk their own paths of healing and discovery.
